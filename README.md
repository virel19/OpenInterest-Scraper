# OpenInterest-Scraper

I created this script to automate the process of gathering market data from a decentralized exchange to analyze market sentiment. It will then send me an email notification when predefined conditions are met. Open interest is a powerful indicator that can tell us the market participation and liquidity, which can be instrumental in predicting future price movements and identifying potential trading opportunities.

#### Predefined Conditions

* If long positions exceed 80% of open interest, it sends a "Short" email notification.
* If short positions exceed 80% of open interest, it sends a "Long" email notification.
* If open interest exceeds $100,000,000, it sends an "Open Interest" notification.

This is what it looks like in the console and it will keep running every 10 min to get the most up-to-date information. This will also be the same information sent to you via email when the conditions are met.

While the data exclusively pertains to the Arbitrum network, it holds the potential to unlock valuable insights into the larger market dynamics and trends across a spectrum of networks and chains. However, it's essential to emphasize that this data alone should not be the sole basis for making trading decisions; rather, it should complement a broader set of analytical tools and considerations.
